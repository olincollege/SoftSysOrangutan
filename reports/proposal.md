# Maze Runner
### Simrun Mutha and Kelly Yen

## Previous Project
**Kelly**: My last project was a bit frustrating because of the amount of set up I needed to do before I was able to write or test any of my actual code. I also worked completely by myself on that project, which made debugging especially difficult as I didn’t have anyone readily available to bounce ideas off of. Another key frustration with my previous project was the amount of time I had to work on it. With this project, I hope to start earlier and utilize my peer and CA resources more frequently to avoid those frustrations. 

**Simrun**: My last project helped me learn how a shell works and what the different types of commands were. I thought that it was well-scoped but I wish I had more time to expand on it and implement some more advanced features. However, I think there were some parts of the code that I did not fully understand when I was following a tutorial. With this project, I aim to make sure I understand my code completely so I feel confident with my end result. 

## Goals
Our MVP for this project is to build a simple, two player maze runner game that runs on a local network using a C implementation of TCP. Both players can connect to the game via their terminals, and race to complete the maze before the other player finishes. Once one player finishes the maze, the game ends and the time is displayed to both players. 

If we’re able to complete the aforementioned MVP, a few stretch goals might include implementing a more advanced GUI or generating random mazes. We could also implement more advanced game features, such as a progress bar showing how close an opponent is to winning, or allowing for more than two players to play at a time. 


## Learning Goals
**Simrun**: I want to learn about how to share data over local networks by using sockets and networks. I also want to get better at organizing code in various files to improve structure and readability. Additionally, I want to get more comfortable with some of the basic C concepts we learned earlier in the semester related to pointers and memory.

**Kelly**: I’d like to learn more about network programming and protocols, as those are areas I have little experience in. I’d also like to use this project to get better at working on collaborative software projects and develop better coding habits. 


## Resources
Here are some of the resources we plan to use:
1. TCP server client implementation: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tcp-server-client-implementation-in-c/
2. Ncurses documentation: https://tldp.org/HOWTO/NCURSES-Programming-HOWTO/
3. More information about network programming:https://beej.us/guide/bgnet/html/
4. Tutorial about socket programming: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/socket-programming-cc/
5. Multithreading socket programming: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/handling-multiple-clients-on-server-with-multithreading-using-socket-programming-in-c-cpp/


## First Steps
1. Our first step would be to thoroughly read through all of the resources listed above to gain a foundational understanding of socket programming in C. *(Simrun and Kelly)*.
2. Follow one of the above listed tutorials on networks and sockets. We know this will be done when we have established communication between our two laptops. *(Simrun and Kelly)*.
3. Implement a simple maze generating algorithm, or hard code a maze (depending on the complexity of generating mazes). This maze should be printed to the terminal. *(Simrun and Kelly)*.
